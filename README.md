# Melanoma Detection
> Using Advanced Regression and EDA to undersatnd important features impcating sales price



## General Information
- Problem Statement - Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## The Data
- We've limited data to work with initially. We'll explore Augmnetation and Upsampling strategies to fix this.

## Solutioning
- We have built CNNs from scratch for this multi class classification problem, as well explore transfer learning. I have tried multiple model architectures along with various data correction strategies
